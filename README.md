# HypercarAnalysis

This is a dataset that contains information regarding 9 hypeercars, with data including; BHP, top-speed, price, displacement and more.
I aimed to dissect the dataset to find the best hypercar within this selection, the most powerful hypercar, and to compare the various factors about the hypercars to find a correlation, e.g. finding a correlation between having high displacement resulting in more HP beign produced.

For the process of data cleaning, analysis and visualisation I used Python via Jupytper to make my code and analysis easy to read and follow.
