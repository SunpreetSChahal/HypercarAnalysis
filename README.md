# HypercarAnalysis

This is a dataset that contains information regarding 9 hypercars, with data including; BHP, top-speed, price, displacement and more. I aimed to dissect the dataset to find the best hypercar within this selection, the most powerful hypercar, and to compare the various factors about the hypercars to find a correlation, e.g. finding a correlation between having high displacement resulting in more HP being produced.

Analysis done using Python via Jupyter Notebooks.
